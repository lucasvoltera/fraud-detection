    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing credit card fraud is a top priority for financial institutions, given the constant threat it poses to consumers and businesses. In Brazil alone, Serasa Experian reports that approximately 12.1 million people fell victim to financial fraud in the past year, resulting in a total loss of 1.8 billion reais over the last 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively detecting fraud is a significant challenge, as legitimate and fraudulent transactions often bear similarities. The complexity is further heightened by the diversity of values and locations where fraud can occur, making pattern recognition challenging. This difficulty can lead to errors in both false positives, such as the preventive blocking of consumer cards, and false negatives, where fraudulent transactions go undetected.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, it is crucial to continually enhance security systems, adopt advanced detection technologies, and invest in more robust authentication methods. Collaboration between financial institutions, regulators, and technology companies plays a pivotal role in developing more effective solutions to mitigate the risks associated with credit card fraud."

    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis and build machine learning models capable of accurately detecting fraudulent transactions. To achieve this, advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques will be employed to identify patterns and anomalies in the data, along with data balancing techniques. Additionally, it will be crucial to assess the effectiveness of the constructed models, both in terms of accuracy in fraud detection and the minimization of false positives."

    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraudulent transactions involve the illicit acquisition of goods and services using stolen payment information. As credit card usage continues to rise, both online and offline, associated fraud activities also escalate. It is crucial for businesses to comprehend this threat, its various forms, and metrics to effectively monitor and combat such activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There're some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that is important to understand:\n",
    "* **Acceptance**: The volume of transactions accepted after authorization and screening.\n",
    "* **Challenges**: Transactions flagged as potentially fraudulent and subject to manual review.\n",
    "* **Denials**: Payment requests rejected by the acquirer or identified as fraud before processing.\n",
    "* **Chargebacks**: Transactions identified as fraud by the acquirer or contested by the customer.\n",
    "* **False Positives**: Legitimate customer transactions incorrectly blocked as fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective fraud management hinges on monitoring these KPIs diligently. Elevated false positive rates, for instance, can lead to lost sales and frustrated customers. Therefore, beyond safeguarding against fraud, companies must ensure their fraud detection solutions don't deter legitimate customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, it is known that the company earns 10% of the value for a correctly approved payment and loses 100% in case of fraud:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fraud Rate**: fraudulent transactions approved / total transactions approved\n",
    "* **Approval Rate**: total transactions approved / transactions received\n",
